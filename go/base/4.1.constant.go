// * Constant names follow the same naming rules as variables
// * Constant names are usually written in uppercase letters (for easy identification and differentiation from variables)
// * Constants can be declared both inside and outside of a function

package main

import ("fmt")

const PI = 3.14   // untyped constant
const A int = 1   // typed constant

func main() {
  fmt.Println(PI)
  fmt.Println(A)
}

// There are two types of constants:
// * Typed constants
// * Untyped constants
